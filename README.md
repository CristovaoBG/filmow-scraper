# Web Scraping Filmow
 
Filmow is an online platform aimed at film and series enthusiasts. It offers a space for users to create profiles where they can list and rate the movies and series they have watched, as well as share their opinions and recommendations with the community. The platform allows users to create personalized lists such as "Favorites" and "Watch Later," making content management easier. Additionally, Filmow provides detailed information about each title, including a synopsis, cast, production team, user ratings, and trailers. With its social approach, Filmow allows users to discover new films and series based on recommendations from friends and community members. In summary, Filmow is a platform dedicated to connecting people who share a love for cinema and television, providing an interactive and informative experience.

This project aims to extract data from this platform, such as user names, their favorites, movie titles, etc. From the extracted data, it is possible to perform data analysis to estimate a user's cinematic taste profile, allowing for the discovery of users with similar tastes and even correlating the favorited movies of users to recommend new films based on their profiles. The project at https://github.com/CristovaoBG/CristovaoBG.github.io implements a movie recommendation website https://CristovaoBG.github.io based on the data extracted from users of this platform.
